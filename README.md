# Time_Series_HW
* This homework assignment focused on analysis of time series data and performing a regression analysis.
* As part of the time series analysis we utilized the ARMA, ARIMA and GARCH models. The p-values for the ARMA and ARIMA were quite high. This indicates we should exercise significant caution when it comes to trading based upon the output of those models. The GARCH model, which predicts, volatility had p-values on the lower end. This indicates we can have some confidence in the output of the GARCH model. If we were to use the GARCH model to influence our trading strategy, we should consider a strategy that capitalizes on volatility. 
* Like the ARMA and ARIMA model the predictive ability of the the regression model did not give me confidence. Although the mean squared errors of the out-of-sample data was lower than the in-sample data the plot of actual return compared to predicted return was not encouraging. I would exercise caution when utilizing this model as part of a trading strategy.
